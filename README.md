# UNI Classbook Project

This project is created in my time at the University and it consists of a Database with tables for students, grades and subjects. The database format can be either Access (.accdb) or Sql (.mdf).

## Going into detail
The project involves ways to access all the three different tables and add, modify or delete an entry. The interface consists of buttons to select the current table, save, load, exit, add entry, edit entry and delete entry.

What is different than most is the diversity of formats that the project accepts. Based on an interface, it can load data from Access type databases (using OleDb) and Sql type datasets (using SqlConnection).
